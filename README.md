A simple calculator app Built with Basic HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT knowledge.

How I did it:

* Built the calculator layout and styled it with CSS.

* Used JavaScript to add real. calculator features.

* Wrote a function that turns on/off the calculator when the power button is clicked (features only works when power is on).

* Used the slice() function to delete the last input on the text area when the delete button is clicked.

* Wrote a function that initializes the display area when the clear button is clicked.

* Used document.querySelectorAll Dom property to select multiple buttons.

* Used forEach() function to add click events to multiple buttons.

* Used the data-value and this.dataset.value to read element values like the "+", "*", "-", "/" operators that are recognized by JavaScript behind the scenes, instead of it's actual values (icons).
